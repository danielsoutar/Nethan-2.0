Nethan
======

Nethan will live again! This time I'm planning to hack some guy's node.js game and implement a networked game of tic tac toe (really want to learn how to write networked applications). The plan is then that one can enter a web-based game with Nethan as their opponent.

For context, NEThan (a rubbish pun on 'net', or 'network') is a neural network I tried to write in Node.js. As is customary with my efforts, I made a total hash of it. But Robert the Bruce didn't succeed the first time and he was a pretty big deal so I'm trying again.

Only bigger. And badder >:)


Full credits goes to Ruben Torres at the following links (being his site with the inspiring page on making the game and the tanks game he made himself, which is pretty slick):
